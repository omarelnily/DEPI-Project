## Project Description

**DEPI Pentest Report** is a detailed security assessment of the DEPI application, aimed at identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing their potential impact, and providing actionable insights to secure the application. This report was prepared following industry-standard penetration testing frameworks like OWASP, NIST, and PTES.

---

## Findings Summary

The report identifies key vulnerabilities categorized by their severity:

- **Critical Issues:**  
  Immediate attention required to prevent exploitation.
- **High Severity:**  
  Significant security risks with potential business impact.
- **Medium Severity:**  
  Moderate risks requiring remediation.
- **Low Severity:**  
  Minor issues with low probability of exploitation.

---

## Technical Methodologies

The penetration test followed a systematic approach to identify vulnerabilities, including:

1. **Information Gathering**: Passive and active reconnaissance to collect critical application data.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated tools were used to scan for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation**: Manual testing to validate identified issues.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Analysis of potential impacts and lateral movement risks.
5. **Reporting**: Detailed documentation of findings and actionable recommendations.

---

## Key Vulnerabilities

1. **SQL Injection**: Found in multiple endpoints, allowing unauthorized database access.
2. **Broken Authentication**: Weak password policies and insecure session handling.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Client-side scripts injection in input fields.
4. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Access control flaws in resource URLs.

---

## Remediation Recommendations

- **SQL Injection**:
  Implement parameterized queries and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Authentication**:
  Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure session handling.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
  Escape user inputs and use Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Access Control**:
  Implement robust authorization checks for all resources.
